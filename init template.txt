Initialization Functions template

To apply this pattern to other modules, you would need to follow these steps:
Initialization Function: In each module, define an init function that handles any setup required for that module. This could include loading configurations, setting up connections, initializing state, etc.
Module-Specific Functions: Define the functions that perform the module's main tasks. These should be designed to be called from other modules or from main.py.
Main Flow Function: Optionally, if the module has a complex series of steps that need to be performed in order, you can define a main flow function like main_feedback_flow that orchestrates these steps.

Here's a template you can use for each module:

# example_module.py
def init():
    # Perform necessary initialization steps for the module
    print("Initialization of Example Module complete.")

def module_specific_function():
    # Perform the module's main task
    pass

def main_module_flow():
    # Main function to handle the module's flow if needed
    pass
And in your main.py, you would do something like this for each module:

# main.py
import example_module

def main(): 
    # Your main application logic here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_module.init()  # Initialize the example module
    main()
    example_module.main_module_flow()  # Run the example module's main flow
For each module, you would replace example_module with the actual module name and implement the specific logic within the init, module_specific_function, and main_module_flow functions as needed.

Remember to only import and call init and main_module_flow (or equivalent) in main.py. The module_specific_function should be called within the module's flow or from main.py if it's part of the main application logic.
