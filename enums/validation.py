# contains functions for validating DE-specific form data
#
# Dalia's tips: 
#Error Handling: Add try-except blocks where appropriate to handle unexpected input.
#Case Sensitivity: Functions like is_valid_entity_name and is_valid_purpose should ideally handle words in a case-insensitive manner.
#Modularity: Consider breaking down some functions further if they start to handle too complex logic.
