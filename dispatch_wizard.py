class DispatchWizard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.listeners = {}
        self.event_queue = []

    def register(self, event_name, listener):
        if event_name not in self.listeners:
            self.listeners[event_name] = []
        self.listeners[event_name].append(listener)

    def dispatch(self, event_name, data=None):
        if event_name in self.listeners:
            for listener in self.listeners[event_name]:
                listener(data)
        else:
            self.event_queue.append((event_name, data))

    def process_events(self):
        while self.event_queue:
            event_name, data = self.event_queue.pop(0)

    def wait_for_event(self, event_name):
        # This method would need to be implemented in a way that makes sense for your application.
        # For example, it could be a blocking call that waits until the specified event is dispatched.
        pass

# In this setup, DispatchWizard now has an event queue that can store events 
# until they are processed. This allows for asynchronous event handling, 
# where events can be dispatched and then processed later in the flow of 
# the application. The process_events method would go through the event 
# queue and dispatch any stored events to their respective listeners.
