config.json.txt

Central Configuration Loader: config_utils.py is responsible for loading config.json and providing access to its contents. This module will read the JSON file once, parse it, and store the configuration in a Python dictionary.

Singleton Pattern: Ensure that the configuration is loaded only once and the same instance is used throughout the application. This is known as the Singleton pattern. It prevents the overhead of reading and parsing the file multiple times.

Direct Access or Getter Functions: Within the config_utils module, you can provide direct access to the configuration dictionary or create getter functions to access specific parts of the configuration. Getter functions can provide additional processing or default values if needed.

Usage Across Modules: Other modules in your application can import config_utils and use the provided functions or the configuration dictionary to access the settings they need.

Error Handling: Include error handling in your configuration loader to manage situations where the configuration file might be missing, corrupted, or if there are missing keys when trying to access configuration values.

Environment-Specific Configurations: If your application runs in different environments (development, testing, production), you might want to override or extend the base configuration with environment-specific settings.
